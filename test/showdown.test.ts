/**
 * The showdown's staging is a pure, DOM-free transform of the reveal and the
 * server clock, so it can be pinned under plain Node the way the seat geometry
 * and the countdown are. `client/src/table.ts` cannot be imported here (it
 * queries `#app` at module scope), which is exactly why the verdict mapping and
 * the beat arithmetic live in `src/shared/showdown.ts`.
 *
 * The three properties worth guarding:
 *
 * - the stamp names the engine's verdict, including the one double charge that
 *   lands on the *doubter* (a real `21`), never the announcer;
 * - a caught bluff and an honest claim are distinguishable — opposite emotions
 *   must not share a layout;
 * - the beats are a fraction of the *server's* reveal window, so a shortened
 *   clock compresses the staging instead of desyncing from the alarm.
